This README file contains build instructions for the AVAPI sample code.

Requirements:

1. iOS SDK 4.3 or above.
2. Xcode 4.0 or above.

---------------------
How to build the app:
---------------------
1. Open Sample_AVAPIs.xcodeproj with Xcode.
2. Replace your device's UID with sample UID in "ViewControll.m".
3. Click "Product" and "Build" in Xcode to build your project.

-------------------
How to run the app:
-------------------
This source code of sample client app is converted from 
Linux/Sample_AVAPIs/AVAPIs_Client.c directly. So it has no UI elements, and it
outputs message to the "Output" panel in Xcode (like a console program).

Before running this app, an AVAPI sample server in Linux/Sample_AVAPIs/ should
be ready for listening incoming connections.
